//Set up ssh on your computer. I like Roger Peng’s guide to setting up password-less logins. 
// Also see github’s guide to generating SSH keys.

//Look to see if you have files /root/.ssh/id_rsa and /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
// If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:
// acept all questions by default and the ssh-key in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "roi.martinez@cefas.co.uk"

// Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard.

# cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings.

// Go to your github Account Settings
// Click “SSH Keys” on the left.
// Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
// Add a label (like “Connection to git in my linux”) and paste the public key into the big text box.
// In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:

# ssh -T git@github.com

//If it says something like the following, it worked:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
not provide shell access.


/// create a new empty repository in Github
/// add remote to the git repository in your folder
/// git remote add <name> <url>
/// using git@github.com structure avoid have to write paswword every commitment and use the ssh key instead

# git remote add origin git@github.com:roimartins/nginx_config


/// then to push the remote and local repository have to pull the two branches togther first

# git pull -u origin master

// then would be possible to push the commitments in the local repositories

# git push -u origin master
